\subsection{Introduction}

Each report must be created in a separate subfolder. Take the "example" folder as an example of a report (please do not change).

All changes are made through GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Intelligent-Systems-Phystech/IntelligentSystem}}. It is recommended to create a new project in overleaf by using <<Import from GitHub>> utility. And after all changes push it back to GitHub by using <<Menu -> Sync -> GitHub>>.

As an example, consider a linear regression problem.


After writing your report, include the report to main.tex similar to the sample report.
